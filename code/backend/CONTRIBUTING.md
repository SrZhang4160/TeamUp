# Contributing Guidelines and Steps

* Check project board and create a task/issue.
* Do not push directly to `main` branch or `iter-xx` branch.
* Use an existing feature branch of an iteration to develop, test, and push code. Or make your feature branch off `iter-xx` branch. Careful not to branch off `main`. Example branch to work in `iter-01-backend`.
* Make changes, write and pass unit tests for all changes.
* Once you have finished work on your branch create a pull request from your feature branch into the current iteration branch or another feature branch. Example: `iter-01-backend` into `iter-01`.
* Please do not approve your own pull request immediately. Post in Slack to have your code reviewed.
* Once at least one and ideally 2 people review it. Address any feedback.
* Continue this process until your code is approved!
* Merge your branch!
* Move your issue in the project board as done. Yay!
