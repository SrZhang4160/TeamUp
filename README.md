# Team Up!

**Try our app at http://47.253.99.242/#/welcome**

In many courses, students need to find their partners without much information about each other. The method they use to form a group now is to group with people they know or post a message through Slack, which is inefficient and hard to create the team that best fits them. Therefore, we propose this app to gather information about all the students and provide team formation services considering multiple conditions. We aim to make your team formation much easier and more fun!
